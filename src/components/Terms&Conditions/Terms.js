        <p>
          These Repair Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) apply generally to all
          repair services (the “Services”) and govern your use of the Services
          and Website (as defined below). TechFix Solutions LLC., a North
          Carolina "Limited Liability Company” has developed a comprehensive
          system for the operation of stores and specially equipped mobile units
          under the trade names techfix®, techfix® by TechFix Solutions™ that
          principally offer and sell the Services and other ancillary products
          and accessories (the “System”). Stores that operate under the System
          are owned and operated both by our affiliates and independent
          franchise owners (together “System Operators”).
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION, WHICH
          REQUIRES THAT ANY DISPUTES THAT SHOULD ARISE FROM THE USE OF THE
          SERVICES SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY BY AN ARBITRATOR, AND THIS
          AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS A WAIVER TO A JURY TRIAL OR ANY CLASS ACTION
          PROCEEDINGS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS
          AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.
        </p>

          in performing the Services, We may use new, rebuilt, reconditioned or

          The Services are not provided as part of the original manufacturer’s
          warranty. If Your Device is under any applicable manufacturer’s or
          other warranty, You acknowledge that the Services may void the

        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="span">6. Availability of the Services:</span>
          The Services are available for all eligible Devices during the
          operating hours of the stores and/or service centers in the System, as
          determined by System Operators. Where applicable, an individual
          seeking to use the Services on behalf of Your company may be required
          to provide identifying information including whether the individual is
          an owner, member, partner, director, manager, employee, or agent of
          Your company. Eligible Service Locations: When You schedule onsite or
          in-home Services, eligibility is subject to participating stores, the
          availability of the onsite or in-home Services in Your geographic
          location, and/or subject to the eligibility requirements set forth in
          this Agreement. We reserve the right to cancel or refuse Services as
          necessary, including if We determine the Service location is cost
          prohibitive for Our Service technicians to travel to in order to
          perform the Services.

          products, and any other devices as determined by Us in Our sole
          discretion. Service eligibility and initiation of the Services is
          subject to: (a) a visual and physical inspection of the device to
          Service; (b) confirmation that the device is eligible, accessible and
          serviceable subject to Our service eligibility criteria which is
          determined at Our sole discretion; and/or (c) confirmation that no

          ineligible or unsafe for the performance of Services. Subject to Our
          sole discretion, We determine eligibility for onsite and in-home
          Services during the scheduling process, and confirm eligibility in
          accordance with the requirements of this Agreement at the designated
          Service location.

          stored on Your Device and deleting, encrypting or otherwise protecting
          Your data from unauthorized use. We are not responsible for any loss,
          alteration or corruption of any hardware, software, data or files. We
          may decline to provide the Services to You if We determine that
          appropriate back-up measures have not been taken by You regardless of

          otherwise arrange for its return for more than sixty (60) days, or
          other longer period as required by law, following the completion of
          Services, Your Device will be deemed abandoned and will become Our

          does not provide coverage for Devices which have been subjected to
          abuse, misuse, damage due to external causes or an Act of God, normal

          resulting from any action by You, including but not limited to
          mishandling, physical damage, operation outside of design limits,
          improper repair by someone other than Us, or unauthorized

          shows evidence of tampering or shows evidence of being damaged as a
          result of excessive corrosion, electrical current, heat, moisture or
          vibration, or as a result of improper specification, misapplication or

          </span>
          Unless otherwise required by law, all replaced Devices, parts,
          components, boards and equipment will become Our property, and You

          year Limited Warranty term, it must be returned to a store or service
          center within the System for evaluation by Us, and You will be

          examination, We determine at Our sole discretion that the parts or
          repairs used to perform the Services were defective, or in the case of
          a replacement Device, that the replacement Device is defective, it
          will be repaired at no charge.
